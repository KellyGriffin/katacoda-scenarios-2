Note: This environment runs `rancher/rancher:master` which is the master build of Rancher, this is for testing purposes only. Please refer to the [official documentation](https://docs.rancher.com) how to setup Rancher.

This scenario will deploy [Rancher](https://rancher.com) (complete container management platform), it will also setup a single node [k3s](https://k3s.io) (Lightweight Kubernetes) cluster and automatically import that into Rancher for management.
